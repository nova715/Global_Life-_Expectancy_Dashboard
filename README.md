Money, Medicine & Mortality: A Global Life Expectancy Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit dashboard exploring how money, medicine, and mortality connect across the world  built with Python, Plotly, and Pandas, it brings data science into the healthcare space blending analytical precision with a medical perspective.


 Overview

This dashboard analyzes global life expectancy trends using real-world data. It examines how GDP, healthcare expenditure, and mortality rates interact across developing and developed nations  revealing the socio-economic patterns behind public health outcomes.

Features

	â€¢	Interactive filters by country, status, and year
	â€¢	Dynamic visualizations using Plotly (bar, scatter, pie, stacked charts)
	â€¢	Key health metrics: Total GDP, population, expenditure
	â€¢	Downloadable CSV for filtered data
	â€¢	Cleaned & processed dataset using Python (Pandas & NumPy)

Insights

	â€¢	Countries with higher GDP and total healthcare spending generally show longer life expectancy.
	â€¢	Developing nations demonstrate higher infant and adult mortality despite growing GDP, indicating inequalities in healthcare accessibility.
	â€¢	Public expenditure on health plays a stronger role in life expectancy improvement than GDP alone â€” emphasizing that economic growth without investment in health doesnâ€™t translate to longevity.

Tech Stack

	â€¢	Language: Python 
	â€¢	Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
	â€¢	Data Visualization: Plotly, Streamlit
	â€¢	Dashboard Framework: Streamlit (for interactive UI)
	â€¢	Version Control: Git & GitHub 

Future Scope

â€¢ Integrate machine learning models to predict life expectancy based on socio-economic indicators.
â€¢ Add AI-driven insights that recommend optimal healthcare spending for developing nations.
â€¢ Deploy the dashboard on Streamlit Cloud for public access.
â€¢ Build a country comparison module with ranking-based metrics.
